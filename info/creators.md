# Creators 101

Everyone can contribute, everyone gets rewarded

## The platform

A few introductory points of the benefits of Amigame as a publishing platform

## Reach

As creators you want your art reaching the biggest audience possible. Everyone has a web browser and they auto-update. Targeting the web platform is the best chance to minimize your cross-platform build cost and reach the biggest audience. 

## No licensing

Proprietary engines compile to web code with emscripsen (for example) but thatâ€™s not your only choice. You can use open frameworks like Construct.js that are openly supported by a community of developers. One of the main benefits of using open source is that elaviates the need for licensing. Less production costs should allow you more flexibility in the risks you can take with gameplay, ultimately producing more interesting games. 

## Revenue

We're sharing our monthly revenue with all developers participating. This creates a constant pasive income stream that could be benefitial in your continious development as a creator. 

Royalties are shared under a fair model that allocates subscriptions based on user activity rather than overall traffic. This closes the gap between the most popular games and the niche games, allowing everyone to have a sustainable profession.
