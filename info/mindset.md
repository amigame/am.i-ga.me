# Mindset

We love video games. 

We were playing video games before they were _"cool"_ with the mainstream. 

We wanted video games to become mainstream, popular. We felt video games is art and it deserves recognition. 

...And we created a monster. The industry has growed into a monstrosity beyond recognition and it hurst us to admit that what we see is more often than not embarassing: 

* **Fake**: the objective now is to show much fun you’re having, at all costs.
* **Impersonal**: thousands of developers in numerous studios under one corporate head
* **Misleading**: girls presenting games yet we have situations like Gamergate occurring?

It would be so easy to just step away and not be involved. But we won't do that. Instead, we're resetting the deck with Amigame, trying to bring back video games where they should be. 

Join us not for the exclusives, not for the popularity but for the love we put into our creations. In fact, we want you to create your own experience. These are your games as much ours. 

Amigame is one of the first user-driven game studios. We are fans of good games and want to create a community around us that have the passion to support original ideas and test out experimental concepts that can lead to innovation.

Once more with feeling: WE ♥ VIDEO GAMES!
