# Mindset

We love video games. 

We were playing video games before they were _"cool"_ with the mainstream. 

The Amigame 
We wanted video games to become mainstream, popular. We felt video games is art and it deserves recognition. 

… And we created a monster. The industry has passed s by as a parent tat nurtures a kid and then hears “Fuck of dad, I don’t need you anymore)

Fake (show how much fun you’re having, at all costs)
Impersonal (thousands of developers in numerous studios under one corporate head)
Misleading (girls presenting games?)

We’re bringing the should back to video games! 

Join Amigame not for the exclusives, not for the popularity but for the love we put into our creations. 

Once more with feeling: WE ♥ VIDEO GAMES!
